/* You are given an array of elements, you can pick them either its positive value or its negative
value and eventually by summing it up you should given target. In how many ways you can achieve this?

It is as same as problem 17) S1- S2 = D

Why because consider this array [1, 2, 3 ,4]

We can take them as [1, -2, -3, 4] S1 will be (1, 4) and S2 will be (-2, -3)
Take minus common and it will become (1 + 4) - (2 + 3) = target
                                      S1     -  S2     = target. */
